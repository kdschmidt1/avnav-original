    <h2><a id="Intro" name="Intro"></a>Technical Background</h2>
    To use charts in AvNav they have to be available in a tile format. This is a
    format used by services like OpenStreetMaps or GoogleMaps. A tile has
    (normally) a size of 256x256 pixel. The world is projected to a flat surface
    (imagine a paper cylinder wrapped around the earth at the aequator). Each
    point with it's coordinates (longitude/latitude) will pe projected at this
    cylinder. How this is performed in detail, which units will be used and
    whether the earth is considered as an ellipsoid or a sphere is described by
    the projection. AvNav is using the so called google mercator projection
    (earth considered a sphere) with the EPSG code 900913. The projected units
    are always meters (but can be converted to longitude and latitude). If you
    have charts using a different projection they have to be reprojected
    beforehand.
    <p>The whole projection area is split into tiles. The zoom level determines
      the number of tiles for the complete area. Zoom level 0 means:&nbsp;
      complete earth (from -85°...+85°, outside these limits the projection is
      undefined) is shown in one tile of 256x256 pixel. With each other level
      there will be more tiles - level 1: 2x2 tiles, level 2: 4x4 tiles. The
      most relevant zoom levels for our usage typically range from 7 to 18..19.
      That means at level 19:2^19x2^19 tiles.<br>
      The <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/">openlayers</a> library is used
      to display the charts. This library loads the tiles based on zoom level
      from the server (raspberry) and displays them on the screen. It is often
      used in OpenStreatMap applications.</p>
    <p> You can easily imagine the huge numbers of tiles required for higher
      zoom levels (if you try e.g. zoom 19 for all). Therefore it makes sense to
      follow the same approach we take for paper charts: for an overview a small
      zoom level is used, detail charts a bit more and e.g. port approaches with
      the highest levels 18 or 19 (60cm/pixel and 30cm/pixel). To still maintain
      a nice display experience the different detail levels can overlay the
      other tiles of less detail. If there is a better (higher) zoomlevel for an
      area this one will be displayed - otherwise the one with a lower zoom
      level (potentially up scaled). To not overload the display devices, the
      number of layers should be limited to 3...5 (depending on the device). </p>
    <p>Additionally AvNav can display vector charts from <a href="https://o-charts.org/">o-charts</a>
      (using the <a href="hints/ocharts.html">ocharts</a> or <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a>
      plugins) and S57 charts (after conversion using the <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a>
      plugin). Those vector charts are converted to the described tiles "on the
      fly" by the plugins.</p>
    <p>You can get charts from various source - either already in formats that
      AvNav can directly use (gemf, mbtiles) or in formats that have to be
      converted (like BSB - .kap files).</p>
    <p>There are also tools available to download such charts outside of AvNav
      or inside AvNav.</p>
    <p>When converting charts the goal is to assign available charts to layers,
      to potentially reproject them and finally create the chart tiles (maybe
      together with a description). Typically this requires a lot of computing
      power (and time) and should be better run on a desktop system. But
      typically this should be no problem as you will do this only once. After
      you will be rewarded with a continous chart view with no gaps inbetween.<br>
      The same has to be considered when it comes to downloading charts. You
      need to carefully select areas and zoom levels. </p>
    <h2><a name="chartformats" id="chartformats"></a>Chart Formats </h2>
    <p>AvNav uses <a href="http://www.cgtk.co.uk/gemf">GEMF</a> as its primary
      format. It is a compact binary format merging all tiles into one file with
      the necessary meta data added. This format permits special functions like
      automatic zoom level adaptation.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Since version 20200325 AvNav can directly use the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MBTiles">mbtiles</a>
      format. To use this format you potentially have to select the correct
      variant of internal tile sorting. The default format is "xyz" but there is
      also a "tms" format available. You can switch the format at the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#mbtiles">Files/Download</a>
      page. You can download MbTiles directly e.g. from <a href="https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/openstreetmap/openseamap/charts/mbtiles/">OpenSeamap</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Hint</b>: Up to version 202011xx AvNav was reading an entry "scheme"
      in the mbtiles metadata. Unfortunately the usage of this entry is not well
      defined and different sources are using differently (see <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/issues/63">Issue
        #63</a>). In earlier editions AvNav internally inverted the meaning of
      xyz and tms. Since version 202011xx AvNav ignores this value (and assumes
      tms). If the value is set in the metadata, the chart will be displayed in
      red and you can visit the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html">Download-Page</a>
      to choose the type to be applied for this specific chart.</p>
    <p>For the handling of the vector charts refer to the <a href="hints/ocharts.html">ocharts</a>/<a
        href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a> descriptions.</p>
    <h2><a name="sources" id="sources"></a>Chart Sources</h2>
    <p>You can get charts from various sources - either in a format that is
      directly usable by AvNav (.gemf, .mbtiles, o-charts) or a format that
      needs conversion before (.kap, s57).<br>
      There are tools available to download such charts - either within AvNav or
      outside.</p>
    <p>A list of chart sources: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Downloading ready to go raster charts (e.g. from <a href="https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/openstreetmap/openseamap/charts/mbtiles/">OpenSeamap</a>,&nbsp;
        <a href="https://distribution.charts.noaa.gov/ncds/index.html">NOAA</a>
        - mbtiles) </li>
      <li> Downloading charts using the <a href="http://mobac.sourceforge.net/">Mobile
          Atlas Creator</a>.</li>
      <li>Downloading charts and converting them inside AvNav (e.g. BSB kap
        files)</li>
      <li>Downloading charts inside AvNav using the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-mapproxy-plugin">mapproxy</a>
        plugin</li>
      <li>Buying charts at <a href="https://o-charts.org/">o-charts</a> and
        using them via the <a href="hints/ocharts.html">ocharts</a>/<a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a>
        plugins</li>
      <li>Downloading S57 charts and converting/using them with the <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a>
        plugin</li>
      <li>Using charts from the <a href="https://github.com/SignalK/charts-plugin">signalK
          chart provider</a> &nbsp; (if the <a href="hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html#SignalK">signalK
          integration</a> is active).</li>
      <li>Using online chart sources, provided they support the default url
        format. You have to configure this with an xml file. An example can be
        found in the provided <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/viewer/demo/osm-online.xml">online
          source for OpenSeaMap</a>.</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    </h2>
    <h2><a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation of Charts</h2>
    <p>After installing AvNav there is one/a couple of online demo charts
      available. For real usage you have to install charts in AvNav.</p>
    <p>How to do this depends on the chart type.</p>
    <h3>Directly usable chart types (gemf,mbtiles)</h3>
    <p>Upload them on the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#chartupload">Files/Download
        page</a>.<br>
      On Android you can also copy them directly to the external chart directory
      (gemf files only).<br>
      For mbtiles consider the option to switch the internal scheme <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#mbtiles">at
        the Files/Download page</a> .</p>
    <h3>Charts with conversion (kap, s57)</h3>
    <p>In normal versions (not Android) you can upload charts that need
      conversion at the <a href="userdoc/importerpage.html">Importer</a>
      (starting from 20200325).<br>
      s57 charts require an installed <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a>
      plugin.<br>
      You should keep in mind that converting can require a lot of CPU power and
      can last for hours on the raspberry pi. Probably it is more efficient to
      run this on a desktop system.<br>
      As the conversion functions are not available for Android, you could
      additionally <a href="install.html">install</a> AvNav on a Linux- or
      Windows-System and run the conversion there. Converted charts can be
      downloaded from the importer and uploaded to the Android app.</p>
    <h3>Vector Charts (o-charts, s57)</h3>
    <p>Those charts require an installed <a href="hints/ocharts.html">ocharts</a>
      or <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a> plugin (on Android the
      avocharts app - see <a href="hints/ochartsng.html#android">ochartsng</a>).
      You cannot use those chart types on windows as the plugins are not
      available (except the converter from s57 to ocharts). For details refer to
      the <a href="hints/ocharts.html">ocharts</a>/<a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a>
      documentations. S57 charts that have been converted will directly become
      visible in the <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a> plugin.</p>
    <h3>Downloading Charts inside AvNav</h3>
    <p>If the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-mapproxy-plugin">MapProxy
        plugin</a> is installed its charts will directly become visible in AvNav
      without any further installation. </p>
    <h2><a name="overlays" id="overlays"></a>Overlays</h2>
    <p>Since version 20201219 AvNav can display further information as overlay
      (or underlay). You can as well combine different charts. </p>
    <p>For details see <a href="hints/overlays.html">Overlays</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h2 class="western"><a id="Convert" name="Convert"></a>Download using Mobile
      Atlas Creator</h2>
    <p>To use the <a href="https://mobac.sourceforge.io/">Mobile Atlas Creators</a>
      you only need Java and the MOBAC itself. It is important to follow a
      certain procedure when selecting the ranges for download&nbsp; in order to
      fit the charts to the described layer concept and to limit the amount of
      data. </p>
    <p>Typically, I recommend to use 3 layers: overview( zoom level 7-10),
      navigation (level 10-15), details (Level 16-18). Afterwards just proceed
      in MOBAC layer by layer. Select the zoom levels for the layer, select the
      areas you want and add them with an arbitrary name. Repeat this for all
      layers. Now save your selection using a meaningful name (the xml file
      could be reused later). Select OsmDroid GEMF (File-&gt;convertAtlasFormat)
      as output format and start atlas creation. In the output directory a
      xxx.gemf file will be created. <a href="#installation">Install</a> this
      on the pi. <br>
      At the <a href="mapsources.html">mapsources page</a> I present a
      collection of useful map sources.</p>
