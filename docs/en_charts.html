    <p>To use charts in AvNav they have to be available in a tile format. This
      is a format used by services like OpenStreetMaps or GoogleMaps. A tile has
      (normally) a size of 256x256 pixel. The world is projected to a flat
      surface (imagine a paper cylinder wrapped around the earth at the
      aequator). Each point with it's coordinates (longitude/latitude) will pe
      projected at this cylinder. How this is performed in detail, which units
      will be used and whether the earth is considered as an ellipsoid or a
      sphere is described by the projection. AvNav is using the so called google
      mercator projection (earth considered a sphere) with the EPSG code 900913.
      The projected units are always meters (but can be converted to longitude
      and latitude). If you have charts using a different projection they have
      to be reprojected beforehand.</p>
    <p>The whole projection area is split into tiles. The zoom level determines
      the number of tiles for the complete area. Zoom level 0 means:&nbsp;
      complete earth (from -85°...+85°, outside these limits the projection is
      undefined) is shown in one tile of 256x256 pixel. With each other level
      there will be more tiles - level 1: 2x2 tiles, level 2: 4x4 tiles. The
      most relevant zoom levels for our usage typically range from 7 to 18..19.
      That means at level 19:2^19x2^19 tiles.<br>
      The <a href="http://www.openlayers.org/">openlayers</a> library is used
      to display the charts. This library loads the tiles based on zoom level
      from the server (raspberry) and displays them on the screen. It is often
      used in OpenStreatMap applications.</p>
    <p> You can easily imagine the huge numbers of tiles required for higher
      zoom levels (if you try e.g. zoom 19 for all). Therefore it makes sense to
      follow the same approach we take for paper charts: for an overview a small
      zoom level is used, detail charts a bit more and e.g. port approaches with
      the highest levels 18 or 19 (60cm/pixel and 30cm/pixel). To still maintain
      a nice display experience the different detail levels can overlay the
      other tiles of less detail. If there is a better (higher) zoomlevel for an
      area this one will be displayed - otherwise the one with a lower zoom
      level (potentially up scaled). To not overload the display devices, the
      number of layers should be limited to 3...5 (depending on the device). </p>
    <p>Additionally AvNav can display vector charts from <a href="https://o-charts.org/">o-charts</a>
      (using the <a href="hints/ocharts.html">ocharts</a> or <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a>
      plugins) and S57 charts (after conversion using the <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a>
      plugin). Those vector charts are converted to the described tiles "on the
      fly" by the plugins.</p>
    <p>You can get charts from various source - either already in formats that
      AvNav can directly use (gemf, mbtiles) or in formats that have to be
      converted (like BSB - .kap files).</p>
    <p>There are also tools available to download such charts outside of AvNav
      or inside AvNav.</p>
    <p>When converting charts the goal is to assign available charts to layers,
      to potentially reproject them and finally create the chart tiles (maybe
      together with a description). Typically this requires a lot of computing
      power (and time) and should be better run on a desktop system. But
      typically this should be no problem as you will do this only once. After
      you will be rewarded with a continous chart view with no gaps inbetween.<br>
      The same has to be considered when it comes to downloading charts. You
      need to carefully select areas and zoom levels. </p>
    <p>The following options for charts are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Downloading ready to go raster charts (e.g. from <a href="https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/openstreetmap/openseamap/charts/mbtiles/">OpenSeamap</a>
        - mbtiles) </li>
      <li> Downloading charts using the <a href="http://mobac.sourceforge.net/">Mobile
          Atlas Creator</a>.</li>
      <li>Downloading charts and converting them inside AvNav (e.g. BSB kap
        files)</li>
      <li>Downloading charts inside AvNav using the <a href="#mapproxy">mapproxy</a>
        plugin</li>
      <li>Buying charts at <a href="https://o-charts.org/">o-charts</a> and
        using them via the <a href="hints/ocharts.html">ocharts</a>/<a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a>
        plugins</li>
      <li>Downloading S57 charts and converting/using them with the <a href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a>
        plugin</li>
      <li>Using charts from the <a href="https://github.com/SignalK/charts-plugin">signalK
          chart provider</a> &nbsp; (if the <a href="hints/CanboatAndSignalk.html#SignalK">signalK
          integration</a> is active).</li>
      <li>Using online chart sources, provided they support the default url
        format. You have to configure this with an xml file. An example can be
        found in the provided <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/blob/master/viewer/demo/osm-online.xml">online
          source for OpenSeaMap</a>.</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="chartformats" id="chartformats"></a>Chart Formats</h2>
    <p>AvNav uses <a href="http://www.cgtk.co.uk/gemf">GEMF</a> as its primary
      format. It is a compact binary format merging all tiles into one file with
      the necessary meta data added. This format permits special functions like
      automatic zoom level adaptation.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Since version 20200325 AvNav can directly use the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MBTiles">mbtiles</a>
      format. To use this format you potentially have to select the correct
      variant of internal tile sorting. The default format is "xyz" but there is
      also a "tms" format available. You can switch the format at the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#mbtiles">Files/Download</a>
      page. You can download MbTiles directly e.g. from <a href="https://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/misc/openstreetmap/openseamap/charts/mbtiles/">OpenSeamap</a>.</p>
    <p><b>Hint</b>: Up to version 202011xx AvNav was reading an entry "scheme"
      in the mbtiles metadata. Unfortunately the usage of this entry is not well
      defined and different sources are using differently (see <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav/issues/63">Issue
        #63</a>). In earlier editions AvNav internally inverted the meaning of
      xyz and tms. Since version 202011xx AvNav ignores this value (and assumes
      tms). If the value is set in the metadata, the chart will be displayed in
      red and you can visit the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html">Download-Page</a>
      to choose the type to be applied for this specific chart.</p>
    <p>For the handling of the vector charts refer to the <a href="hints/ocharts.html">ocharts</a>/<a
        href="hints/ochartsng.html">ochartsng</a> descriptions.</p>
    <h2><a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation of Charts</h2>
    <p>After installing AvNav there is one/a couple of online demo charts
      available. For real usage you have to install charts in AvNav.<br>
      You upload the charts directly within the WebApp (some only starting from
      20200325). Upload can be executed via the <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#chartupload">Files/Download
        page</a>.</p>
    <p>On Android you can also copy charts directly to the external chart
      directory. For android you have to consider that mbtiles can only be
      handled after explicit upload&nbsp; - instead of simply storing them in
      the external chart directory.<br>
      For mbtiles consider the option to switch the internal scheme <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#mbtiles">at
        the Files/Download page</a> .</p>
    <p>In standard versions (not android) starting from 20200325 you can also
      upload charts that still require conversion. The converter as described
      in&nbsp; <a href="#Convert">Converting</a> is always included in AvNav.
      It will read files from it's import directory (/home/pi/avnav/data/import)
      or from sub directories. When <a href="userdoc/downloadpage.html#chartupload">uploading</a>
      a file with a known filename extension (like .kap) you will be asked if
      you want this file to be loaded to the converter import directory. You can
      monitor the working state of the importer at the <a href="userdoc/importerpage.html">importer
        page</a>. Starting from 20240520 you can also upload zip files with many
      charts inside to the importer. You can also upload to the importer
      directly on the<a href="userdoc/importerpage.html"> importer page</a>. <br>
      You should keep in mind that converting can require a lot of CPU power and
      can last for hours on the raspberry pi. Probably it is more efficient to
      run this on a desktop system.</p>
    <p>If the <a href="#mapproxy">MapProxy plugin</a> is installed its charts
      will directly become visible in AvNav without any further installation. </p>
    <h2><a name="overlays" id="overlays"></a>Overlays</h2>
    <p>Since version 20201219 AvNav can display further information as overlay
      (or underlay). You can as well combine different charts. </p>
    <p>For details see <a href="hints/overlays.html">Overlays</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Convert" name="Convert"></a>Converting Charts</h2>
    <p>As described you can run the conversion directly on the pi - but it will
      take time.</p>
    <p>It is potentially more appropriate to run the conversion on a desktop
      computer. You can do this on Linux or Windows machines. For the necessary
      installations see:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="install.html#Packages">Linux</a></li>
      <li><a href="install.html#Windows">Windows</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The chart converter is a normal part of AvNav. Since 20240520 there is a
      separate <a href="userdoc/importerpage.html">page</a> in the App to
      control and monitor it. See the description of the <a href="userdoc/importerpage.html">importer
        page</a> for the usage. Some of the available conversions are part of
      AvNav, others are provided by plugins. The converter will analyze the
      uploaded chart and select a suitable converter.<br>
      The internal converter will be able to handle .kap files, mbtiles files,
      navipack files. It also can handle zip files with kap files inside.<br>
      The conversion process depends on the type of the chart. The converted
      charts will be directly written to the chart directory of AvNav (or to the
      appropriate directory of a plugin).<br>
      You can also download them directly.</p>
    <p>For kap (BSB) charts the conversion includes the following steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> sorting the charts into layers (and potentially converting them) </li>
      <li> creation of tiles </li>
      <li>creation of the gemf file</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Details</h4>
    <p> Here are some details about the conversion steps of the internal kap
      files converter. Normally you do care about them. <br>
      But if you are unhappy with the results of the conversion you still could
      run the conversion using the command line.<br>
      The read_charts.py is located at /usr/lib/avnav/chartconvert.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <div style="font-size:small">
        <p>The first step is fast. All chart data will be read, resolution and
          range will be detected. If necessary charts would be
          converted/reprojected. As a result there will be a chartlist.xml in
          workdir/&lt;name&gt; . The command line would be:</p>
        <pre>read_charts.py -g -o name -m chartlist inputdir [inputdir...]
</pre>
        <p>Afterwards you can check the chartlist.xml and you could e.g. move
          some charts into a different layer.</p>
        <p>The second step will take more time -&nbsp; now the tiles are
          created:</p>
        <pre>read_charts.py -g -o name -m generate inputdir [inputdir...]
</pre>
        <p>The file chartlist.xml must already exist at&nbsp;
          workdir/&lt;name&gt;. The creation will run multi threaded.</p>
        <p>At the end you need to create the gemf file:</p>
        <pre>read_charts.py -g -o name -m gemf inputdir [inputdir...]</pre>
        <p></p>
        <p>You could also combine all steps:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>read_charts.py -g -m all [-o name] inputdir [inputdir...]

</pre> </blockquote>

    <h3 class="western"><a id="Download" name="Download"></a></h3>
    <h2 class="western"><a name="mapproxy" id="mapproxy"></a>MapProxy plugin</h2>
    <p>A <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-mapproxy-plugin">plugin</a>
      is available to embed <a href="https://mapproxy.org/">MapProxy</a>,&nbsp;
      providing access to various online chart sources. The plugin will support
      you in configuring MapProxy and allows to comfortably download charts. For
      details refer to the <a href="https://github.com/wellenvogel/avnav-mapproxy-plugin/blob/master/Readme.md">plugin
        documentation</a>.</p>
    <p>The plugin offers a lot of functionality very similar to Mobile Atlas
      Creator and it can replace it in most cases.</p>
    <h3 class="western"></h3>
    <h2 class="western">Download using Mobile Atlas Creator</h2>
    <p>To use the <a href="https://mobac.sourceforge.io/">Mobile Atlas Creators</a>
      you only need Java and the MOBAC itself. It is important to follow a
      certain procedure when selecting the ranges for download&nbsp; in order to
      fit the charts to the described layer concept and to limit the amount of
      data. </p>
    <p>Typically, I recommend to use 3 layers: overview( zoom level 7-10),
      navigation (level 10-15), details (Level 16-18). Afterwards just proceed
      in MOBAC layer by layer. Select the zoom levels for the layer, select the
      areas you want and add them with an arbitrary name. Repeat this for all
      layers. Now save your selection using a meaningful name (the xml file
      could be reused later). Select OsmDroid GEMF (File-&gt;convertAtlasFormat)
      as output format and start atlas creation. In the output directory a
      xxx.gemf file will be created. <a href="#installation">Install</a> this
      on the pi. <br>
      At the <a href="mapsources.html">mapsources page</a> I present a
      collection of useful map sources.</p>
